I told you so
it's high time
just about
just a minute
just a second
just because
just for the record
just in case
just like that
just now
just so
just then
just the thing
just this once
kind of
knock on wood

once more
once too often
once upon a time
on demand

thank God
thanks a lot
that is
that's all
that's it
that's that
the hard way

the real thing
there's no telling
the same old
the same thing
the whole time
this and that
this minute
through and through
time after time
to be exact
to be expected
to begin with
to be precise

to say the least
to spare
to start with
to tell the truth

to this day
tough luck
trial and error
under control
under pressure
under protest
under the weather

up front

up yours
very well
watch it
what about
whatever you do
what for
what if

who cares
why not

within reach
within reason
without exception
without fail
